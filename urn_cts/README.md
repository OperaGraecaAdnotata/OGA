# URN CTS

This folder contains files with bibliographic information for the texts
included in OGA.

The file `texts/urn_cts.xml` was created automatically using the
information contained in the `__cts__.xml` files in the original repositories.

The file `texts/urn_cts_plus_date_label.xml` contains the content of the file
`urn_cts.xml` with specification of alleged composition date and date label for
each work. The file `duplicates_tlg_pta.xml` documents the works in OGA that have different
CTS URNs, but are the same.
