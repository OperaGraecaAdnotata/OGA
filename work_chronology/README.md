# Work Chronology

This folder contains a file with the alleged composition dates of Greek 
works in the ISO 8601 format, which has been used for annotation in OGA. 
The dates have been manually annotated by one annotator 
and are a work in progress.

Since dates are added manually, BCE dates are annotated using the Em Dash (U+2014)
instead of the Minus Sign (U+2212) to prevent confusion between the Minus Sign
and the Hyphen-minus (U+002D), which look similar (the latter is used as a separator, though). 
If the file is processed automatically, replace the Em Dash with the Minus Sign.
