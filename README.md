# Opera Graeca Adnotata v0.2.0

This repository contains the documentation for
**Opera Graeca Adnotata** (OGA), a multilayer corpus
of Ancient Greek texts with automatically generated annotations
(the by far largest one of its kind) üèãÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉ:

* number of base texts: **1,999**, each corresponding to an ancient work
* number of tokens: **40,105,221**

The Ancient Greek works comprised in OGA are listed in
`query_values/cts_work_date.md` and come from the repositories:

* Canonical Greek (https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/releases/tag/0.0.11376425141)
* First1KGreek (https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek/releases/tag/1.1.11352615003)
* PatristicTextArchive (https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_data/releases/tag/1.1.11363682704)

Because of the corpus large size,
the actual corpus data + its documentation
are made available on Zenodo at

* https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8158675

The data can be queried (also) through the Annis search tool at:

* https://annis.varro.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/oga020

To know more about how to query the corpus with Annis,
see the documentation in the folder `query_values`.

An overview of the corpus can be read on the accompanying website at

* https://varro.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/oga/en/index.html

The present repository contains a few
useful manually annotated files used to create annotations in OGA,
whose expansion and correction anyone can contribute to. 

The corpus can be queried by:

1. word forms (i.e., tokens)
2. lemmas
3. morphology (POS and morphological features):
4. syntax (dependency syntax following the AGDT annotation scheme)
5. CTS URN for work, authors, and editions.
6. CTS internal structure of each work (e.g., "book", "section", "line", etc.) 
6. author name
7. work title
8. alleged composition date for each work
9. (experimental) IPA transcription of word forms (classical pronunciation)

The morphosyntactic annotation and lemmatization are the outputs of
(i) a parser and (ii) lemmatizer trained on 1,2M+ tokens of AGDT data 
(a much larger dataset than all UD ones combined): the
parser and lemmatizer are documented in the article 
[A State-of-the-Art Morphosyntactic Parser and Lemmatizer for Ancient Greek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12055). Since the training dataset contained 
a large selection of texts of different ages and genres, 
the models used for OGA are expected to generalize much
better than those trained on much smaller (UD) datasets. 
The final scores for the models are:

|POS|XPOS|Feats|ALLTags|UAS|LAS|Lemmas|
|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
|96.41|91.90|94.77|91.56|82.60|77.10|91.41|

The annotations for CTS URN, CTS passage, author name, and work titles are
retrieved automatically from the original texts (and therefore they may
contain errors and inconsistencies).

The annotation for the work date has been done manually and is work-in-progress.

The IPA transcription is based on a Seq2Seq model that achieved an accuracy
of **0.83** (correct IPA transcriptions) on Greek and Latin data 
from Wikitionary.

The present repository is organized thus (further details within each folder):
1. `abbreviations` contains a file useful for tokenization.
2. `annotation_example` contains an unzipped example of the
annotation layers, which is useful for inspection.
3. `elision` contains a file used for tokenization.
4. `tokenize` contains files used for tokenization.
5. `urn_cts` contains files with bibliographic information
about the texts in OGA.
6. `work_chronology` contains a manually annotated file with the alleged composition dates
of Greek works.
